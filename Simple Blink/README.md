# Simple Blink MSP430G2553 and MSP430f5529

In this project the Green LED on the two MSP430 launchpad families will be blincked on certaini time interval. In approching the implementaion of this this project the Watch Dog Timer (WDT) has been devactivated. The watch dog timer is an electronic timer that is capable of reseting the system when there is a computer malfunction. Since this project is to only blink an LED we're better off deactivating it.
